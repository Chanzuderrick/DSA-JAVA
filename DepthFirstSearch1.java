     * DEPTH FIRST SEARCH
     * its a search algorithm for traversing a tree or a graph data structure
     * we can break this into three steps
     * 1. pick a route
     * 2. keep going until you reach a dead end, or a previously visited node
     * 3. backtrack to last node that has unvisited adjacent neighbours
     * 
     * one way we can keep track of our position is to use a stack
     * we can use a call stack
     * whenever we visit a node we will push it to the stack
     * if we are unsuccessful we will use step 3 by popping the elements in the stack till we reach the first element
     * then we begin the process again till we are successful
