         * non linear data structures where nodes are organized in a hierachy

         * HTML DOM
         * top of the tree is known as the root node. it has no incoming edges
         * any nodes at the bottom of the tree are called leaf nodes. dont have outgoing edges
         * any nodes in the middle are called branch. they have incoming and outgoing nodes.
         * Nodes with outgoing edges are known as parents
         * Nodes with incoming edges are known as child nodes
         * nodes can be parent/children
         * any two nodes that share a common parent are known as siblings
         * subtree is a smaller tree within a larger tree
         * size of a tree is equal to the number of nodes
         * depth: number of edges below the root node
         * height: number of edges above the furthest node
